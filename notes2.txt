Implement votes -> need to register if it is a vote up or down -> Use boolean

🎮 rails g model vote user:references question:references is_up:boolean
🎮 rails db:migrate
do we need an index on the migration ?
    # this type of index is a composite index, where we're indexing in more than one field
    # its a good idea to put such index of our queries incluidng both user_id and question_id in them
    # add_index :votes, [:user_id, :question_id]
    if you fetch votes from a voter -> use normal index
    if query select from user_id and question_id-> use composite index

➕ vote.rb model ->> add validations
    validates :question_id, uniqueness: { scope: :user_id }

➕ question.rb model ->>
    has_many :votes, dependent: :destroy
    has_many :voters, through: :votes, source: :user

➕ user.rb model ->>
    has_many :votes, dependent: :destroy
    has_many :voted_questions, through: :votes, source: :question

🎮 rails g controller votes
edit routes
  resources :votes, only: [:create, :update, :destroy]
  we do shallow because we pass user with user_id, not through the url

➕ edit votes controller
  add methods create, update, destroy

➕ edit question.rb
  def voted_by?(user)
    votes.exists?(user: user)
  end
  def vote_for(user)
    # votes.find_by_user_id user.id ->always gives you one
    # where gives you a collection
    votes.find_by(user: user)
  end

➕ edit question.rb model
    remove voted_by? method since we aren't using it


never define variables in model
move them to controller show
  @vote = @question.vote_for(current_user)


➕ edit show
  <% if @vote.nil? %>
  <%= link_to 'Vote Up', question_votes_path(@question, {is_up: true}), method: :post %>
  <%# button_to 'Vote Up', question_votes_path(@question, {is_up: true})%>
  <%= link_to 'Vote Down', question_votes_path(@question, {is_up: false}), method: :post %>
  <% elsif @vote.is_up? %>
    <%= link_to 'Un-do Vote Up', vote_path(@vote), method: :delete %>
    <%= link_to 'Vote Down', vote_path(@vote, {is_up: false}), method: :patch %>
  <% else %>
    <%= link_to 'Vote Up', vote_path(@vote, {is_up: true}), method: :patch %>
    <%= link_to 'Un-do Vote Down', vote_path(@vote), method: :delete %>
  <% end %>

➕ Helper method to avoid creating two instance variables
  # def current_vote
  #   @current_vote ||= @question.vote_for(current_user)
  # end
  # helper_method :current_vote

➕ability.rb
  can :vote, Question do |q|
    user != q.user
  end
  cannot :vote, Question do |q|
    user == q.user
  end

➕ votes controller

➕ check in terminal that user cannot update-> how?
  v = Vote.find 14
  change user id
  v.user_id = 1
  v.save
  in website try to un-like -> now it isn't allowed

➕ show
(<%= @question.votes_total %>)
➕ question.rb
  def votes_total
    votes.where(is_up: true).count - votes.where(is_up: false).count
  end


📝 count -> db gives you back count -> a number
📝 length -> db gives you back an array of results
  when you can delegate something to database always do it,
  its faster than javascript and Rails
  always delegate to db its better


➕ vote.rb
  def self.up
    where(is_up: true)
  end

  def self.down
    where(is_up: false)
  end

➕ question.rb
  def votes_total
     votes.up.count - votes.down.count
  end

/////////////TAGGING QUESTIONS\\\\\\\\\\\\

to add foregint key tags must exist
rails g model tag name
